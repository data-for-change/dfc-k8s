# Logging

Logs are aggregated from all deployed workloads via Promtail/Loki and available via Grafana.

Our Grafana instance is available at https://grafana.dataforchange.org.il/, 
ask an admin to create a user for you with relevant privileges.

You can browse logs via the Grafana explore app at https://grafana.dataforchange.org.il/explore,
at the top left of the page, select `Loki` as the datasource.
